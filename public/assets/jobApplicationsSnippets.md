## Tell me about yourself

I am a software engineer with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I have 5 years of professional experience, mainly in front-end development using React.
I worked on various projects and dived into a lot of concepts of front-end development, from content-driven websites focused on accessibility, keyboard navigation and SEO to data-driven web apps with complex forms, data-rich charts and tables, reusable UI components and design systems.
I have experience in leading other developers, performing code reviews and enforcing certain patterns, project-specific standards and best practices.

## Something excited you recently

I was recently implementing a complex date range picker component from scratch.
After I was done, I figured I could improve the animations with a cleaner, simpler straight forward implementation
I had a very big moment of excitement after re-implementing the animations where I was going back and forth between months just to admire how slick and smooth the new animations were
