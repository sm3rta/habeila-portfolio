-Tell me about yourself:
I am a software engineer with strong analytical and problem-solving skills. I have 5 years of professional experience, mainly in front-end development using React.
I worked on various projects and dived into a lot of concepts of front-end development, from content-driven websites focused on accessibility and SEO to data-driven web apps with complex forms, data-rich charts and tables, reusable UI components and design systems.
I have experience in leading other developers, performing code reviews and enforcing certain patterns, project-specific standards and best practices.
Please consider taking a look at my portfolio: https://habeila-portfolio.netlify.app/


-Achievements/Recent achievement:
I led a team of 3 to 4 front-end developers in the process of creating and maintaining features while setting design system standards for the design team to follow.


-What excites you about this company?
{Company name} has a reputation for being a great place to work, with a strong culture and a team of talented and dedicated individuals so I think it's going to be a great learning experience for me. And in return, I'm a very motivated and dedicated engineer who likes to get the job done.


-Something excited you recently:
I was recently implementing a complex date range picker component from scratch.
After I was done, I figured I could improve the animations with a cleaner, simpler straight forward implementation
I had a very big moment of excitement after re-implementing the animations where I was going back and forth between months just to admire how slick and smooth the new animations were
