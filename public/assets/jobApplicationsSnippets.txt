I was recently implementing a complex date range picker component from scratch.
After I was done, I figured I could improve the animations with a cleaner, simpler straight forward implementation
I had a very big moment of excitement after re-implementing the animations where I was going back and forth between months just to admire how slick and smooth the new animations were


I am a software engineer with 4 years of professional experience, mainly in front-end development using React.

I worked on various projects and dived into a lot of concepts of front-end development, from content-driven websites focused on accessibility and SEO to data-driven web apps with complex forms, data-rich charts and tables, reusable UI components and design systems. I have experience in leading other developers, reviewing their work and enforcing certain patterns, project-specific standards and best practices.

I led a team of 3 to 4 front-end developers in the process of creating and maintaining features while setting design system standards for the design team to follow.
